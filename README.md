# 📶 Wi-Fi Network Scanner

A Python-based tool to scan nearby Wi-Fi networks and display essential information such as SSID, signal strength (dBm), and BSSID.  
This project helps users analyze signal quality and identify the best available network for connection.  
It supports both CLI and GUI modes and runs on Windows/Linux systems.

## ✨ Features

- 📡 Scans and lists nearby Wi-Fi networks
- 📶 Displays SSID, BSSID (MAC address), and signal strength (RSSI in dBm)
- 📊 Sorts networks by signal strength for easy comparison
- 💻 Provides both Command-Line Interface (CLI) and Graphical User Interface (GUI)
- 🧩 Cross-platform support: Works on Windows and Linux
- ⚡ Lightweight, fast, and easy to use
